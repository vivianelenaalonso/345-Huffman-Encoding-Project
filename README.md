Purpose: The purpose of this program is to test Huffman Encoding with different structures and approaches. 
You can view the four main Huffman Encoding classes: HuffmanTreeLetter.java, HuffmanTreeWord.java, HuffmanArrayLetter.java,
HuffmanArrayWord.java and test them all by running HuffmanTest.java and providing text to encode or a encoded text file to 
decode. In addition you can test them individually, for example by running TreeWordTest.java for HuffmanTreeWord.java.
